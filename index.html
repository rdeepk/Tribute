                    <p>Guru Gobind Singh Ji was a great warrior, a poet, a philospher and a spiritual leader. He had to spend most of his time fighting against the oppression and suppression committed by the unjust forces. He was a unique nation builder who fought for righteousness. He sacrificed his all for human liberty, equality and fraternity. Two of his youngest sons aged 9 years and 7 years were bricked alive because they chose not to budge from their believes and priniciples defeating all the efforts of Nawab of Sirhind. Two elder sons aged 18 years and 16 years were martyred in the battle of Chamkaur Sahib. His father Guru Teg Bahadur Ji was beheaded because he challenged Emperor Aurangzeb on behalf of the Kashmiri Hindus, ending Aurangzeb's threat to either convert to Islam or be executed.</p>

India had then been under Muslim rule for 350 years. The tyranny of the victorious Muslims was boundless. The Hindu women in their thousands were not only molested and taken into individual harems but were auctioned for the petty consideration of two dinars. Hindus were butchered in thousands, their idols broken and set in the door-steps of mosques where Muslims placed their shoes hefore entering. They were asked to keep food-stuff, clothes and bare necessities of life needed for a period of six months only and hand over the rest to Muslims. A Hindu was forbidden to keep a fine horse, house, woman, children and things with him or wear a white turban. Whenever a Hindu chess-player emerged triumphant over his Muslim adversary or a Hindu wrestler worsted his Mohammedan opponent in the arena, he was ordered to embrace Islam or be beheaded. They had to pay jazia (tax) for remaining Hindus, and those who could not afford to pay, had to become Muslims. The Hindus had lost their country and were on the verge of losing their identity and faith. Guru Gobind Singh Ji infused the spirit of both sainthood and soldier in the minds and hearts of his followers to fight oppression in order to restore justice, peace, righteousness (Dharma) and to uplift the down-trodden people in this world. But in my opinion, his greatest victory was eliminating the fear of death from the minds of peace-loving sikhs, with his most recent masterpiece culminating in the form of <a title="Battle of Saragarhi" href="http://www.australiansikhheritage.com/saragarhi/">Battle of Saragarhi</a> in 1897.</p>

                <p>The sapling of Sikhism which was planted by Guru Nanak was watered by the blood of Guru Arjan and Guru Hargobind and fertilized by their bodies. Guru Teg Bahadur quickened its growth by injecting into its veins the vital fluid flowing out of his beheaded body. Guru Gobind Singh ji helped it mature into a full- fledged tree with the blood of his five beloved disciples, four sons and thousands of his followers. At last this tree bore fruit. Its fruit was nationalism, brotherhood, love and monotheism.</p>

                        <p>Guru Ji was a well-versed scholar of many languages like Urdu, Hindi, Sanksrit, Persian, Braj Bhasha and Gurmukhi (script). His divine poetic compositions are all of phenomenal literary level. Guru Ji composed Jaap Sahib, when he was just 19 years old. Jaap Sahib describes the attributes of the Almighty in an ultimate rhythmic style. The vocabulary and connotations used are  not restrictive, rather the message delivered stresses on universal-ism, and a person from any background/faith can relate to it. Through his literary writings, Guru Ji preached his message of  oneness , love , equality and moral code of conduct (like the former Gurus). The 'Baichitar Natak', a great literary work of Guru Ji, includes description of several events from the Guru's life. Guru Ji was also well-versed in the art of music. In fact, he invented beautiful instruments like "Taus" and "Dilruba". Guru Jee was adept  at the usage of weapons and archery. He owned the most sophisticated and exceptional weapons of those times. These are still present in Hazur Sahib, Nanded. One of his weapons, a very unique javelin, called 'Nagini Barcha', was used by Bhai Bachittar Singh, to kill the drunken mad elephant which was sent by the Mughal forces to attack the Sikhs, when they were in the fort of Chamkaur.  Guru Ji fought many battles, but  his intention behind fighting  battles was never political, ie., he did not fight to own a land or to increase his territory, like other kings did. He never initiated any attack. All the battle fought by him were the result of the attack by unjust people misusing their power. His main purpose was to preach his divine message, so fighting for materialistic gains was of no interest to him. But yes, he did fight against tyranny, oppression and injustice. He preaches the same in his bani (words), that one must pick up the sword , only when all other efforts of curbing oppression have failed. Guru Gobind Singh Jee cherished art. It is said that there were  52 celebrated poets  in the Guru's darbar (court).</p>

                        <p>If we look back into the past, in the time of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, we can see that a very significant history has been created and all his life is so full of significant events that it is difficult to pick some. However, if we look closely at the month of December, in 1704 AD we will find that a plethora of significant events took place; these were not just significant historical events related to Gurus and the Sikhs, but these were events that turned the course of history. Lets look at these events in brief.</p>

                                    <h3>December 1704</h3>
                                    <p>The Mughal army along with the armies of Hill Rajas had laid a siege on Anandpur Sahib Fort since 3 May 1704. All the supplies coming to the fort were cut off, and the seven month long siege had depleted all the resources inside the fort, and there was nothing left in the fort to eat. In addition, hunger, thirst, scarcity of supplies, restriction on movements had taken their toll as well, yet Guru Ji was in a firm and high spirits. It was the hardship and the hopeless situation that made the forty Sikhs sign the "Disclaimer" that we are not Sikhs and walk out of the fort, unharmed by the forces that laid the siege.</p>

                                    <p>Although, Guru Ji was being pressured by the exhausted Sikhs to take on the promise of safe passage and evacuate from the fort, but Guru Ji said that enemy's intentions were not sincere and they could not be trusted. Finally, at the behest of famished Sikhs and mother of Guru Ji Mata Gujri Ji it was agreed that the fort will be evacuated, although Guru Ji was still not in favor. On this fateful night of 20 December the fort was evacuated at night. The mid-winter night was dark and bitterly cold, and now on top of that it began to rain heavily. The unfavorable weather and the flooded River Sirsa in full spate, did make the task of evacuation formidable. Now, on top of this forces that had laid the siege forgetting their promises of safe passage, pounded on the Sikhs and very heavy fighting took place.</p>

                                    <p>It was early morning now. Most of the fighting had died, still the bullets, arrows were flying and rain was falling but Guru Ji did not deviate from the daily morning ceremony of singing of bani. After the prayers were offered and Guru Ji asked to prepare for crossing the River Sirsa. Guru Ji had just crossed the swollen river and other Sikhs were in the midst of crossing the river, when a contingent of the Mughal army arrived. The commander of Guru Ji's forces who was guarding the rear end of the column, single-handed resisted the chasing Mughal army, so that others could cross the swollen river. Many sikhs gave their life but held the advancing forces for long time to allow remaining Sikhs and two eldest Sahibzade to cross the river.</p>

They kept moving so that they could escape from the harm's way and by chance they met Gangu who was cook in Guru Ji's household. He took them to his village Kheri promising shelter but in the morning turned them over to the officials of Nawab of Sirhind. Guru Gobind Singh Ji accompanied by his two older sons and a group of forty survivors marched towards Ropar. There the village people refused to offer shelter for fear retribution and directed them to a brick kiln. There Guru Ji decided to camp for the night. However, a landlord farmer Chaudhri Budhe Chand of Chamkaur offered his haveli (type of house in a shape of fortess) to Guru Ji as that will provide some shelter, cover and protection against the chasing armies. By night time the marauding Imperial forces also reached Chamkaur and had surrounded this mud house designed like a fort.</p>

                                    <p>Next day, early morning of 22 December the Imperial army of hundred thousand against 45 sikhs attacked with the aim of capturing the fortress and Guru Ji. There, Guru Ji assigned eight of his Sikh soldiers each in a party of two to guard the entrance and the four walls. Guru Ji situated himself on the upper floor and from there not strategically directed his Sikh soldiers but also kept an incessant shower of arrows. Thus from the vantage position Guru Ji not only commandeered the fight but also with his arrows complemented the ground forces resisting the advancing armies. The general of the Mughal army Nahar Khan and Ghairat Khan tried to scale the wall with the help of a ladder but were shot down in timely manner by Guru Ji with an arrow. The death of the leader quite demoralized the attacking forces. Now, Nawab of Sirhind took the lead and asked his forces to make the final charge. Both the elder sons of Guru Gobind Singh Ji and three of five Punj Pyares, and around thirty of the Sikhs gave their lives there defending the haveli.</p>

                                    <p>Only five Sikhs were left to defend the place. They persuaded Guru Ji to retreat and save himself in the larger interest of the nation, so that Guru Ji can still carry on the mission and create new bands of Khalsa. This was done by the remaining five Sikhs in form of a "Gurmatta" (a unanimous resolution) and Guru Ji bowed to the mandate of the supreme authority of Khalsa Brotherhood. So, under the thick cover of night, Guru Ji left the haveli with three of his disciples. The remaining two were assigned the duty of defending the haveli. Even when Guru Ji was forced to retreat he blew the bugle and announced thrice and then other Sikhs kept on repeating the same words: "Peerae Hind may ravad." Meaning: The sage of India has escaped.</p>

                                    <p>The three Sikhs accompanying Guru Ji could not keep pace with Guru Ji and in the darkness got separated from him. Guru Ji fatigued, barefooted, with his clothes in tatters trudged along the thorny wilds of Machhiwara and arrived in a garden. For days he found neither food nor shelter. His feet were blistered and bleeding. He slept in the woods with an earthen pot as his pillow and open sky as his quilt in the winter nights. But his spirit was undaunted, neither his noble resolve nor his patriotic fervor ever flickered. The super resolve of his spirit is enshrined in his own words as his poetic composition which he sang there. His words refer to the futilities of life of luxuries, if the remembrance of God is missing. The story of his wandering is not just a romance of hair breath escapes, but also celebration of great valor, firm and noble resolve not to surrender, and full faith in the Creator. After three days the three separated Sikhs rejoined the master. The saga of history continued to be created by Guru Ji, as he moved to Hehar, on to Jatpura, and then on to Raikot. It is at Raikot Guru Ji learnt about the fate of his mother and two younger sons.</p>

                                    <p>On 23 December the two younger Sahibzadas aged nine and seven years were produced in the court of Nawab Wazir Khan of Sirhind. There, they were enticed to change their faith with promises of positions in kingdom and marriages into the royalty. When the persuasions and temptations failed to produce the desired results the ruler resorted to threats, torture including deprivation of food and sleep. For four cold winter nights they were forced to spend in an airy tower to weaken their spirits and resolve.</p>

                                    <p>On 27 December a council of ministers were called upon to consider ways and means to bring the princes into the fold of Islam. The princes were brought to the court and an inevitable choice of death or acceptance of Islam was offered to them. The princes, true to their faith, preferred death over conversion. At that time, Diwan Sucha Nand rose from his chair and walked closer to two princes and asked them if they were released what will they do? Their reply was that we will go to jungles and raise army of Sikhs, procure horses, arms so that we can fight the oppression. The reply infuriated Diwan Sucha Nand and he counseled the Nawab; "Sir, this progeny of a cobra had better be smothered in time." A very cruel form of execution was devised. The Sahibzadas were bricked alive, and when they fainted out of suffocation, they were beheaded. The grandmother Mata Gujari expired in the prison on hearing about the tragic end of her two beloved little grandsons. This tragic event took place on 27 December 1704.</p>

Even after learning about the brave deaths of his remaining two younger sons, Guru Ji spirit was still high and his statement; "What if I have lost four sons, but countless more alive." is a testimonial to his ever high spirits. Guru Ji declared they have not died, but have become immortal. They have lifted the downtrodden and shown the way to liberty. Guru Ji declared that the rule of Mughals has been uprooted. The colorful history continued to be created..</p>

                        <p>In the early part of 1699 Guru Gobind Singh Ji sent out messages to his followers to make a special effort to attend the Baisakhi festival. So thousands gathered at Anandpur Sahib. After the morning service Guru Ji appeared before them on specially erected platfrom. Suddenly he stopped staring at the crowd, he pulled his sword out and raised it high with his right hand. There were a million voices and then a sudden hush. Now, like a thunder, the Guru spoke, "My dear Sikhs, I am glad to see so many of you here today. Today I have planned to offer you something special. but for this I need your help. Indeed, I need your head. I need the head of a Sikh who claims his faith in me. If anyone among you claims to be a true Sikh, then come forward and prove it." Before he had finished his last sentence, a tall lean Sikh was already moving forward towards the Guru on the platform. His name waas Daya Ram and he was from Lahore. Reaching the Guru, he folded his hands, bent his head forward and said, "O, Lord, the true Guru, I claim to be your humble Sikh. My head is ready for you. Please take it." Hurriedly, the Guru held him by the arm and led him into the tent. Soon after the crowd inside heard the sound of a sword striking a body. They then heard a voice, Waheguru and then a loud thud. Then they saw the Guru coming out of the tent, looking even more fierce. Fresh blood dripped down his sword. The crowd was truly horrified. Nobody needed to be told what had happened inside the tent. Once again the Guru stood on the platform. The same demand was repeated and four more times Sikhs stepped up and offered their lives to Guru Ji.</p><p>Then the Guru appeared. He was followed by five sikhs who gave their heads. All were dressed in saffron colour, with blue scarved tied round their waists and turbans. They looked very much like the Guru himself. All stood on the platform facing the crowd. Their faces beamed with joy and satisfaction. the Guru spoke to the crowd, "My dear Sikhs; we all remember that when Guru Nanak gave a test to his Sikhs only one passed it. Now two hundred years after the first test, I have given you another final test. However this test was not for Guruship, but for the 'nationhood'. I call it the Khalsa, the brotherhood of the pure at heart. You have witnessed the birth of the Khalsa. These Sikhs standing beside me are my Panj Piaray (five beloved ones). Each of them is a saint and a soldier in one. These five Sikhs are dedicated and daring enough to lead; and strong enough to support the edifice of the Khalsa." Later the Guru introduced his Sikhs to a new kind of initiation ceremony called the Amrit (Baptism). First he Baptised the 'Panj Piaray' and gave them a new name - 'Singh'. Then he himself was baptised by 'the five' and called himself Gobind Singh instead of Gobind Rai. He considered the entire Khalsa as his sons and daughters , not only his four biological sons. So does he say, For the Khalsa (my children), I have sacrificed my 4 (biological sons). So what if four are dead? Thousands of my sons will live hereafter! Guru ji considered the Khalsa as his own image, and said that he himself is present within the Khalsa.</p>
